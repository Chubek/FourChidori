# FourChidori

I made this to cool off and make sure 60mgs of Lisdexamphetamine does not go to waste.

This extension notifies you which board you are on before clicking the link that says `Start a New Thread`.

Get the extension from the release section (to your right) and whatnot. It's not signed. It's not worth signing.

You can expand upon this and get it signed and released as a regular add-on. One possible thing to add is, instead of a meme of Boxxy, you can have an specific image for each board. It's easily achieved, it just takes some taste to choose the right image which I don't have.

Now I gotta go. Good luck.
